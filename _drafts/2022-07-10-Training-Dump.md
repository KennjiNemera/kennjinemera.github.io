### Habits to get the most of the next few weeks

* Build quick solutions from past ideas
* Review other's code and make notes on improvements
* Learn Some Javanese for the hell of it
* Interact with other contestants
* Implement some core algorithms quickly and build out the template

### Review From TC6

Last training camp before IOI. There are a few notes to make before we travel. We learnt alot about our ability to implement ideas to problems that you have figured out...atleast partially anyway.

* You will need to redo a few problems, work on the implementation as well as the speed of them.
* There were a handful of important topics discussed, namely...
    - Binary Lifting
    - BiConnected Components
    - Block Cut Diagrams
    - DP On Trees
    - Strongly Connected Components

> Primarily work on CSES, aim for fast and organized implementation.
