IOI 34 is exactly (100100) days away. In the past few days it has really dawned on me that I didn't know my way around the abc's of programming this time 2 years ago.

## Context

Hello. I was recently given the privelage of participating in IOI 2022, representing South Africa. Every IOI is undoubtably special and dear to hearts of all the contestants but what sets this one apart is that it is the first onsite IOI post pandemic.

## By accident???

To spare you from formalities, I wanted to share the unconvential CP (Competitive Programming) route I took and how it all started by accident...

At a point during the peak of lockdown, my YouTube recommended was flooded with Michael Reeves and 'AI learns to...' videos. They had me hooked! Quickly beginning to see a future where I had their wizardry, I set out on a journey to craft the perfect roadmap to take me there.

### Google Maps

Without a strong grasp of a single programming language except High School level Delphi, I was overwhelmed to hear terms such as 'Linear Regression', 'Web Sockets', 'Machine Learning' & 'Jupyter Notebooks'. I had begun to obsess over step 10 before even putting on my shoes, quickly convincing myself that if I was going to have the slightest chance at comprehending that aggressive lingo, I'd have to ace all the side quests.

### How not to slay the dragon

The first logical step seemed to be improving general logic and programming ability and some way or another I found myself on CodeWars and HackerRank. The interview prep track sustained me long enough to find comfort in it's clear instructions and dopamine-inducing submissions pages. 

In hindsight, I was afraid of the openendedness of development even though it is my primary interest. I felt super sensitive to failure and to put it in terms of a video game timeline...I excessively worked on side quests to guarantee that I'd be ready when I faced the boss...however, I'm yet to face it.

## Algo Rhythms

So in 2020 we gave the national programming olympiad a go and it was memorable. In South Africa, there are 3 rounds before you are considered for IOI Training Camp, and in 2020 I crashed and burned out of Round 2. Nevertheless, I felt like I had more to give and definitely alot more to learn.

Much of the following year was filled with Greedy and String problems. Despite my rather slow pattern recognition skills, I saw improvements, quickly followed by episodes of regression but the overall trend was positive, I was becoming a more competent problem solver and more importantly, I began to have fun.

### But bro...CP is so niche!

There are times when the problem statements just miss the bounds and seem so impractical and rather trivial. You begin to question the value of the time spent with synthpop oozing out of your eardrums & cringing at the thought of yet another edge case.

As I commited to longer format problems and trusted the journey of solving the problem, I began to see the beauty of an olympiad question. It is a unique feeling to go from a somewhat incomprehensible problem statement to working and efficient code.

So this remainded a habit and I was lucky enough to pass through into the 2021 camp setup and thereafter made the team. 

## Blind Hope

I understand that certain countries have it easier than others. To me however, this more so felt like an exercise in commitment than outright skill. I do not have a background in competitive math nor have I been bitten by a spider or sing like Mike Ross. 

Given how low my odds were, I appreciate this opportunity even more and hope to apply blind faith in other areas of my life. You never truly know how far you can go if you keep picking away the
