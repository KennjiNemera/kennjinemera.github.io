### Learning Log

- [ ] Expressing possession
- [ ] Expressing 'This' & 'That'

# Background
My mother tongue is Afaan Oromo and would say I can hear and speak it well enough to express myself with other native speakers. Most kids in the Ethiopian diaspora, regardless of background, have probably encounted Amharic more times than they can count. I will admit that I have had more than ample time to pick this language up. For years, I've heard it over the phone, in songs, movies and with family / friends. It dawned on me that I've heard most essential words and phrases but just haven't learnt sentence construction and understood what all those words up there meant. 

_I'm closer to conversational ability than I would have first thought_

## Motivation

Language Learning has been awfully challenging for me. I'm starting to realize that the difficulty was self-imposed, I didn't offer myself the chance to fail and learn in public out of fear of "looking dumb". However, this marks the turning of a new leaf. Where I change my attitude towards learning and learn like the linguistic toddler that I am. 

Why Amharic to start this journey?  

Well, the most obvious reason being that I already have a knowledge base, secondly I really enjoy some songs and thirdly I just want to more easily connect with the speakers that I come across.

## Disclaimer

Evidently, this is not meant to be followed as a complete guide to the language. The notes made below are entirely based on my weaknesses and personal bias. It is a cheat sheet at best.

## Pronouns

| I         | Ine       |
| You (m)   | Ante      |
| You (f)   | Anchi     |
| You (p)   | Inante    |
| We        | Inye      |
| He        | Issu      |
| She       | Iswa      |
| They      | Irswo     | 

# Verb Conjugation

The way in which verbs are conjugated depend on context, particularly the party being spoken to.

## General Rules

### Future Tense
Prefix of _te_ followed by the base word + pronoun specific suffic
> eg. You are going = te+hed+aleh = tehedaleh

### Past Tense
No prefix follows the base word. Simply append suffix based on the pronoun the verb is being conjugated with.
> eg. You are going (plural) = heidachihu

### Present Continuous
Simple. 'Iye' + Past Tense form of verb + 'Now'
> eg. She went = iyeheidech no

### 'To Go' -> Mehed (just a little reference)

|  Base Pronoun | English Phrase | Amharic Phrase (Past) | (Present Continuous) | Future             |
|:--------------|:--------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|--------------------|
| Ine | I am going | Heidku | Iyeheidku no | Ihedalehu |  
| Ante | You are going |  Heidk | Iyeheidk no | Tehedaleh |  
| Anchi | You are going (female) | Heidesh | Iyeheidesh no | Tehejalesh |
| Inante | You are going (plural) | Heidachihu | Iyeheidachichu no | Tehedalachihu |
| Issu | He is going | Hede | Iyehede new | Yihedal |

## Expressing 'This' & 'That'
|English    |Amharic    |
|:---------:|:---------:|
|that (masc.)   |ya |
|that (fem.)    |yacch  |
|those  |innazziya  |
|this (masc.)   |yih    |
|this (fem.)    |yicch  |
|these  |innazzih       |

_Ok but how do we use this practically?_

Here are a few examples...

- innizzih tamariwocc
- yih bet
- yacch astamari
- innizziya t'iru sewocc.

It is important to note that if a preposition precedes the demonstrative, it changes

- bazzih bet (in this house)
- bazziya bet (in that house)
- tamariwocc kazziyacch timhirti betocc (students from those schools)
