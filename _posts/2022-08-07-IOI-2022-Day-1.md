The sunrise was running a little late I thought as we touched ground in Singapore at 6AM on a Sunday morning. After years of binging _Airport Wars_ I couldn't be happier to experience Changi and it's overindulgent splendor.

## Changi Airport :)

Skytrains, The Jewel, Gardens, Massive Flight Schedules, Thee Food Court - All wonderful things that helped justify why they call Changi a destination in an of itself. We had about 3 hours to burn before the Jakarta flight, this meant walking through as much of the airport as possible. Emmanuel and I knew about the Jewel or "The Egg" as it will now be referred to as. So we began the long stroll from Terminal 3 To Terminal 1. Our mouths were watering as we zipped past little kiosks for food from all over Asia. We swore that we were right next to what should be the jewel. Surely this massive marketing stunt would be easier to find right???

That's where it clicked, the Jewel wasn't just a terminal attraction, it was also a public attraction. We would need to pass immigration - which is suprisingly free for an Ethiopian passport! - to gain access. We turned back in despair because it would just take too long; so with a little more time on our hands, I took in the setting a little more attentively. I've never seen that much genetic variation anywhere ever! Singapore literally flies to major land mass except the poles, A CITY-STATE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! 

The Sun began to rise and we made our way to the food district, picked up some chinese food as the airport become noticeably more busy. 

### Losing Bit

We knew all too well the kind of fatigue that would hit after we got some food in our stomachs. As we grew all the more sluggish, we thought it would be best to head to our gate back at T3. The skytrain peered into our soul and sucked us in like a Discord Nitro phishing attempt. The sun began to rise in Singapore and we were met with a densely vegetated oasis and the _2030 Egg_ in all it's glory! 

While waiting to pass security at our gate; the familiar warmth of - our long-serving mascot - Bit was absent. Now I do not want to proport any blame in Bit Lore but mistakes were made and we wondered if we would ever see Bit the Python again. Taariq made a last ditch effort to rescue bit from the void that is Changi, however, this proved unsuccessful. 

Out of all the places that Bit could get lost, Singapore definitely isn't the worst - all the optimization problems must've rubbed off on him.

### Bumping into other teams

To confirm whether or not a group was an IOI team, it involved 3 steps: 

1. Were they a group of 4 relatively young people (mostly male, it is what it is)
2. Would you bet that they all come from the same country
3. Do they respond after you shout 'orz'

The first familiar face was errorgorn, which meant we just bumped into the Singaporeans, and another party of 1 that I can't recall
right now. The Team Leaders lead the introduction though so that wasn't a great sign of what interactions for the rest of 
the week would look like. We didn't expect much though, since many of the other teams were flying from Qatar or from wherever else, directly to Jakarta.

## Selamat Pagi

### ke mana? 

While waiting for boarding, Benjamin brought out his drawing pad to play OSU (this was not an isolated incident) The IOI Discord started to heat up, with most teams already well into their journey. We would take this short flight to Jakarta with the party we met earlier and the humble Norwegians.

I had a window seat on the A350 and I was determined to witness the scattered cargo ships surrounding singapore. I should've expected that the taxi out to the runway would take a while, unfortunately longer than my will to stay awake could resist. A plane takes off from Changi every 40 seconds...WILD! At some point during flight prep, I passed out majestically - I had been awake for 24 hours - and only woke up thousands of feet in the air. I've been ***tired*** before but never did I think I could sleep through a launch procedure. 

Luckily though, I woke up with enough time to catch a glimpse of the coastline.

The short flight saw us ascend over countless islands you'd all expect to be from Life of Pi. Not long thereafter, we hit land over the mighty island of Java. Upon first glance I noticed all the rice fields and almost perfectly green vegetation. The buildings had classic Asian maroon roofing; The sheer frequency of mosques was also very interesting to observe. Joekarno Hatta definitely wasn't convential, flavoured considerably differently from Changi. 

### Immigrasie?

After the Great Airport Chaos in europe recently, things went pretty well. However, the great divide meant that my ethiopian passport was a liability. So I was sent on my way to the immigration queue. My hands got quite clammy, not all of it was due to the sweltering heat though. Stood behind me were suited men and other teams I was yet to get a good look at. The elderly man that called up me up to the counter took one look at my maroon book and called for reinforcements. To my surprise, I was not surprised.

I was sent to a back room where they asked for my documents and waited somewhat impatiently, wondering where our assistance officer had gone. To create an even more ominous scene, a hench rat decides to fly past the room while some other guy sat in the corner chainsmoking. Which in the moment didn't seem like that bad of an idea. Our guide met me in a trance, quickly snapping me out of it, and spoke to the big boss who gave me the green light. I gave the chainsmoker an understanding nod and left the scene.

### Slops and cops

Firstly, the tracks of the skytrain felt like Temple Run, not to mention the _sus_ shrine. Also, The motorcycle fever of asia hit us right in the face. We trudded along with the norwegians trying to find a place to lay low during the 6HR layover. Up next was a Batik Air flight that had our names on it. I didn't want to think about all the obscure national airlines all over Indonesia - I still don't understand how they've amassed all the islands that make up the country today.

I sent out a wave of geoguesser rounds to my friends, I couldn't muster up the courage to send any more than this though. We knew that the number of teams wandering the airport was slowly accumulating, but we found some seats and slept the grogginess away. To kill time in the check in queues, we played rounds of this guessing game that kept us hooked for long enough. Many of the stores near to the boarding gate were packed with anything and everything that came out an asian kitchen.

## Jogja

The boarding gates were secluded and very unique. Unlike the cookie cutter urban terminals, the airport generally really reminded you that were in indonesia as much they could. Teams began zooming past us while we waited at our gate. Emmananuel and his bird's eye view clocked Rainboy walking ahead of us, that was a true fanboy moment from all of us. 

After we got a good chance to look around, we knew that we were joined by the Americans, Taiwanese and Spanish Teams. A true diplomatic mission. On the journey, we saw the odd mountain or volcano. 

Rice farms, saturated landscapes, dense jungles, Java found a way into the IOI despire after all.

## Selamat Datang Di Jogjakarta

We landed as the sun began to set, the baggage carousel saw us meet many other teams just standing around. Familiar faces from old contest photos. We noticed the IOI stalls and images of the still to be understood mascot scattered around the airport. Emmanuel and I just kept circling to hear all the accents around the carousl. Taariq sent us out to greet some teams, not as easy as it should have been, but I went up to the Turkmenistani's and did a little dance.

Luggage acquired and we began to make our way to the exit. We got stopped for an organized team photo (that seemingly disappeared into thin air) Amidst the all the movement, I could sort of make out some traditional music being played near the exit. The entrance of the airport was filled with Javanese dancers, photographers and what seemed to be local delegation. This procedure happened independently for each team that arrived. I caught a little bit of it on the GoPro.

## Party Bus

It was here that we met our guide Yovitha, who without a doubt helped make this trip as awesome as it was. As we left the airport, it was already pretty late into the evening so much couldn't be seen as we drove through a dimly lit Yogyakarta. Colourful banners, Indomie spots, Fauna everywhere, that's about as much as I could make out between me passing out and hitting rough road.

## Hazmat

The hotel was connected to a mall that stayed packed right up to 10PM. Working hours in South Africa felt a little odd after I learnt that evening business hours are the norm for most of the world. We offloaded our luggage and this was when we got a chance to get a good look at the other teams, and a new friend from the Phillipines. The lobby was filled with Liason Officers, Press and IOI Banners. Yovitha told us that before anything else, we'd need to get covid tested. The rather painful nose insertions became a signature part of the week. Contestants that tested positive at all would then be isolated in their rooms indefinitely, fortunately we stayed clear for long enough to avoid any hiccups. Unfortunately, not all teams had the same luck, for instance, I think that we only met El Salavador 3 days into the trip, an Italian was out for the entire week and the Brits got hit before Contest Day 2.

We were brought back to the info desk and received the IOI supply drop: Bags, T-Shirts, stickers etc. There were probably 20 floors on this building just packed with everyone involved - once again, I was so excited to see so many different looks and hear countless accents. We made it up to floor 13, where we got 2 rooms opposite from each other. I bunked with probably the best vegan OSU player at IOI. 

## Mezaline

Standing in the elevator, there was one button in particular that stood out. MZ. The first guess was that it would lead to the city mall but apparently, there are Î
