*Points to mention on this day*
- Birthday
- Precursor and love for flying
- Singapore airlines and the little things
- What was I expecting?

### Birthday
I turned 18 today, and even though I wasn't stoned at a club somewhere "edgy" to pass the occasion, travel days are awesome in their own right. Some of the most memorable days for me growing up were flight days. Even just the airports have such a rich cultural footprint of their location...languages, accents, people, clothing, food, that annoying airport loudspeaker and I can't go without bringing up beloved Immigration. So I wasn't disappointed to find out that 10 hours of the day would be in transit to Singapore...actually I was ecstatic!

While I understand the dread one might have before embarking on a long-haul flight. I was H Y P E D. Growing up I got to travel home to Ethiopia every now and then and it was roughly a 5 hour flight from South Africa. Although I was a little spoilt and only really experienced _Boeing 777's_, my raw love for what it means to fly has outlived my many other brief interests. 
 
## Wait what?
For context, I am on my way to the IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics) - a computer science competition for students from all over the world. 4 students are sent from each country and this year's edition was held in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Given that we flew from Johannesburg; my teammates and I had to fly through Singapore and Jakarta.

### Strolling around Terminal A

Oh yes! It was my first flight on an Airbus A350, there is one for the archives. I was a little jealous though with the massive Emirates A380-800 just parked up alongside us. We (I) couldn't leave without taking any souveniers though. So I nabbed this South Africa "hat"? designating myself as the flag bearer. Tried convincing Emmanuel to tag team with the hats but the cringe overcame his sympathy...I'm not mad though, it was awful.

## KrisWorld

Where is Kris because I need to him that Singapore Airlines is awesome! 13 hours of flying and 8 of Transit were on the menu. By the end of the "South African Day" we would land in Changi...yes...THEE CHANGI!!! On boarding we would be greeted with classical music...it couldn't get more boujee than this I thought. 

I came prepared: universal adapters in stock, laptop charged, files downloaded, neck pillow locked in. I was going to finish my IT PAT in style. This was prime time to get through all the work I've had to brush under the seat. However, my attempts were in vain. There was simply too much to observe. I would learn that there were many Aussies on the flight which I thought was pretty cool, the last group of Australians that I bumped into was in a very different setting :/ The flight tracker made me aware of how True Speed fluctates as a function of altitude. There were also a few Liverpool supporters around me "celebrating" a draw since the flight had Live TV and I had to brush up on my Bahasa of course!

Taariq and I didn't get a lick of sleep, I did get through Phase 1 of the PAT though, but I didn't really care beyond this point and decided to give Breaking Bad a shot...and it was anything but! My own fault here but I really wonder what the ethnic heritage of Singapore looks like. I say this because the female flight staff had these patterned dresses that were interesting.

### Alignment
I am really appreciative of how I was able to spend my first week as an "adult". My dad helped to keep me as calm as possible and reminding me to have as much fun as I could. My friends shared a similar sentiment. Regardless of the performance that would follow, I would thank God for the experience and the circumstances that I had to work through to get this far.
